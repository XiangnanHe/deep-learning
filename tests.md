Here are examples of questions you could be asked in the test:

Machine Learning Quiz:
You’ve run the Principal Components Analysis algorithm on your data. The sum of the eigenvalues you obtained is equal to the sum of the variance of the data features.

    a) True
    b) False

Deep Learning Quiz:
You are building a neural network to separate the data below. Green circles (resp. blue crosses) indicate positive (resp. negative) labels. Based on the graph below, what can you say about the bias of the model?



    a) The model has low bias.
    b) The model has appropriate bias.
    c) The model has high bias.

Machine Learning Coding Quiz:

Consider this code block:
-----
import numpy as np
a = np.random.randn(20, 4, 2)
b = np.random.rand(1, 4, 1)
c =  a*b
-----

What’s the shape of c?
   a) This operation will result in a shape mismatch error.
   b) (1,4,1)
   c) (20,4,2)
   d) (1,1,1)

General Coding Quiz:
What’s the output of this code?
——
def op(x):
    if (x % 3 == 1):
        return x % 3
    else: 
        return x + op(x-1)
    print(op(12))
——
   a) 1
   b) 23
   c) 13
   d) 22
   e) It will output an error.
   f) None of the above.

Mathematics (Algorithms, Statistics and Probabilities) Quiz:
Which, if any, of the following sorting algorithms use a "pivot"? (Check all that apply.)
    a) Bubble sort
    b) Quick sort
    c) Merge sort
    d) Insertion sort
    e) None of the above

In parameter estimation, a small confidence interval is more desirable than a larger one.
    a) True
    b) False
Speed Coding:
Write a function which takes as input a list of integers, and outputs a new list containing only the first and last elements of the input list.
